I am a second year undergraduate student from the University of Science and Technology of China, currently majoring in Geophysics and minoring in Computer Science. I studied physics competitions in high school and achieved the first prize at the provincial level in the Hunan region of the 39th National Physics Competition for Secondary School Students. I have a wide range of interests. In art, I like to play guitar and sing; in sports, I am good at tennis and long-distance running.
